                <strong>13 years old</strong>, Hassabis became world runner-up in chess, and wrote his first artificial intelligence chess program.<br>
                <strong>In teenage years</strong>, Hassabis became addicted to computer games.<br>
                <strong>17 years old</strong>, Hassabis took a gap year. He joined in the Bullfrog Productions,Ltd and began his computer games career.
                He began first by level designing on Syndicate, and then co-designing and lead programming on the classic computer game <Theme Park>,
                which sold several million copies.<br>
                <strong>22 years old</strong>, Hassabis set up his own game company Elixir Studios. In addition to manage the company,
                He served as executive designer of the games《Republic:The Revolution》and《Evil Genius》.

                <strong>Foldit:</strong><br>
                A functinal game which allows players to fold the chain of amino acids into the appropriate three-dimensional shape in the form of challenges.
                It connects scientific questions with the public, and aggregates wisdom through an online platform.
                <h5>For example, a player once cracked the crystal structure of AIDS reverse transcriptase in 10 days, a scientific puzzle which existed about 15 years.</h5><br>
                <strong>During Hassabis's postdoctor period in MIT</strong>, he was exposed to <mark>Foldit</mark>, being amazed at the great potential for human intuition to find new patterns in games.<br>

                <strong>35 years old</strong>, Hassabis co-founded the artificial intelligence company DeepMind, 
                with the mission of “Use games as a testing ground for proving and opening up AI algorithms”.<br>
                <strong>In 2016</strong>, AlphaGo, a program built under Hassabis's leadership, defeated world champion Lee Sedol.<br>
                <h5>At that moment, the experience of playing Foldit flashed through his mind.<br></h5>
                <h5>"If AI can train from 0 knowledge,and beat top human players, it can also do the work of a scientist with 0 knowledge of biochemistry, just like Foldit players."</h5>
                <strong>Since then</strong>, the protein folding problem became a key step for DeepMind to move from game intelligence to solving real-world problems.<br>
